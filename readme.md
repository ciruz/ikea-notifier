# IKEA Notifier

While waiting for something to be back in stock at my IKEA store, I was really annoyed checking the IKEA web site all the time.
So I made this notifier app with node.js, it notifes you when a product is back in stock. It checks the stock for a specific IKEA product and IKEA store every 15 minutes.

Works for all countrys, just copy the correct product URL.

## Installation

``npm install``

## Commands

``node index.js URL_OF_YOUR_PRODUCT``

Example:
``node index.js http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S09006390/``
